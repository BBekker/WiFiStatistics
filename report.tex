\section{Abstract}

In this report the effect of signal strength, frequency and data rate on the amount of CRC failures in WiFi networks is analyzed. Several hours of data was collected using a laptop with it's WiFi adapter and a python library pyshark. This library is a python wrapper for tshark and allows packet parsing using wireshark dissectors. (insert resultaten)


\section{Hypotheses}

Packet loss can occur when the signal is insufficiently strong
